Conditional Statements (control statements)
-------------------------
1. if
2. if else
3. nested if
4. switch

Note: All the Conditional Statements in java executed if given
      condition is true. and it returns boolean value (true / false)

1. if
-------
-> If the given condition is true, then statements under if block
   get executed
-> if the given condition is false, then statements under else 
   block get executed
Note: 
 1. You must use only relational operators in condition
    ex: == , != , > ,< , >= ,<=
 2. multiple conditions can be formed in the if condition with the
    help of logical operators only 
   ex: && (all the conditions must be true)
       || (any of formed condition should be true) 


switch
---------
-> It switches the given value, and checks with each and evrry case 
   in the switched block. if any case is matched, then corrosponding 
   case statements get executed. If no case is matching, then 
  statements under 'default' is executed. 

  Note: break is used to termenate the condition block.

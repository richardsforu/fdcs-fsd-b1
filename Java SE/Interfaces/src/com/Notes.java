 * 		Notes
 * 		--------
 * 	-> Interface is a method specification which contains zero or
 *     more abstract methods only.
 *  -> By default every method defined in the interface act like
 *     'abstract' method
 *  -> By default every property in the interface act like 
 *     'public , static and final '
 *     
 *  -> All the sub classes of the interface must implement/override all the
 *     abstract methods of an interface.
 *     
 *  -> If any sub class of an interface not overridding any one of the 
 *     abstract method of an interface, then that sub class must be defined
 *     as 'abstract'
 *     
 *  -> We can not create an object to an interface
 *  
 *  Notes
 *  --------
 *  1. A class can implements more than one interface at a time
 *  2. A class can extends only one class at at time
 *  3. A class can not implements another class
 *  4. A class can not extends to another interface
 *  5. An interface can not implements another interface
 *  6. An interface can extends to another interface
 *  7. An interface can extends more than one interface at at time
 *  8. A class can extends to another class and can implements
 *     more than one interface at a time. In this case extends 
 *     keyword should appear before implements keyword.

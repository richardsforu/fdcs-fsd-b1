 *   Notes
 *   --------
 *   1. An abstract class is a method specification which contains 
 *      zero or more abstract and concrete methods
 *   2. abstract methods do not specify body. 
 *   3. All the sub classes of abstract class must override all the 
 *      abstract methods of abstract class
 *   4. If any of the sub class of abstract class is not overriding
 *      any one of the abstract method, then that sub class must be
 *      defined as 'abstract'
 *      
 *   5. We can not create an object to an abstract class. but we can
 *      create a reference of to abstract class
 *
